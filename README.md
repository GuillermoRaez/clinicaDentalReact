# Frontend React Project NÂº6

This is the 2nd project related to the MongoDB database that we created for the project nÂº5. In this case we are adding a UI experience to the DataBase in order to visualise how our database works with React.

# The project. ðŸ”§

The project itself consisted on creating a Dental Clinic website (UI) connected to a database in which the user is able to access different routes and also able to do the following:

- Register
- Login
- See appointments

To all my classmates, who have multiple times wanted to lend me a hand on this project, concerning the incovenients encountered during the realisation of the project. And, I also want to share a special thought for my partner [https://github.com/adrianfurlanc](Adrian) which is going through a difficult time.
